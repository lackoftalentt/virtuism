## üåü Key Features  
1. **Pagination and Category State**  
   - Each category has its own pagination state, allowing users to pick up right where they left off when switching categories.  
   - Active page states are managed using Redux Toolkit, ensuring consistent behavior across the app.  

2. **Dynamic Movie and TV Show Details**  
   - Using `useParams` from React Router, the app fetches and displays detailed information about movies or TV shows dynamically without storing extra data in Redux.  

3. **Search Functionality**  
   - Integrated with the TMDB API to allow users to search for their favorite movies or TV shows.  

4. **Favorite Movies**  
   - Favorites are managed with local state, keeping things simple and lightweight.  

5. **Comment Section**  
   - Users can leave comments on movie pages, powered by Firebase.
